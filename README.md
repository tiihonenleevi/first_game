This is my first game project, which I started by following Brackeys' YouTube tutorial: "How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial".

After completing the tutorial, I decided to expand the game further to learn more about game development.

Most of the assets in the game were provided by Brackeys. The assets I created myself include:

- The key
- The checkpoint flag
- The stars that appear from the checkpoint flag
- The pumpkin house
- The gate

This project helped me improve my understanding of game mechanics, asset integration, and basic game logic in Godot.
